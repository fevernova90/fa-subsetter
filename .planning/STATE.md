## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-roadmap]: Update react-scripts 3 → 5 to resolve ~200 of 239 vulns; staying on 3.x leaves most unfixable
- [Pre-roadmap]: Replace node-sass with sass (dart-sass); node-sass deprecated, has CVEs, fails on Node 18+
- [Pre-roadmap]: Add basic tests before any upgrade; existing smoke test is fragile under Jest 27
- [Phase 01-pre-upgrade-baseline]: Use applyMiddleware(thunk) in test stores; rootReducer import avoids REDUX_DEVTOOLS crash; global.fetch mock for jsdom

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: fontawesome-subset 1.x → 4.6.0 call signature needs verification against 4.6.0 README before upgrading (MEDIUM confidence from research)
- [Phase 4]: archiver 3.x → 7.x append()/finalize() API compatibility needs direct comparison against existing call site in server.js before upgrading
